## Overview

This repository contains a security assessment exercise for reviewing a fictional company's security practices, identifying vulnerabilities, and recommending improvements.

## Objective

Review a fictional company's security practices and identify potential vulnerabilities and improvements.

## Duration

1 week

## Company Scenario: "TechStart Inc"

A 50-person startup with the following setup:

- **Systems:** Cloud-based (AWS), web application, employee laptops

### Current Practices

- Shared admin passwords in a text file
- No backup system
- Employees use personal email for work
- Public WiFi used for work
- No security training
- Software updates done "when remembered"

## Assessment Tasks

### Identify 5 Major Security Risks

For each risk:

- Explain each risk clearly
- Rate severity (High/Medium/Low)
- Explain potential impact

### Recommend Solutions

- Specific, actionable steps for each risk
- Prioritize by urgency and cost
- Include timeline estimates

### Create Security Checklist

- Daily, weekly, monthly security tasks
- Employee security best practices
- Emergency response procedures

## Example Risk Assessment

**Risk:** Shared Admin Passwords

- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Impact:** Complete system compromise if password is leaked
- **Solution:** Implement password manager, unique passwords for each admin
- **Timeline:** 1 week
- **Cost:** $50/month for password manager

## Additional Scenarios to Consider

- Employee receives phishing email
- Laptop stolen from coffee shop
- Ex-employee still has system access
- Customer data breach occurs

## Deliverables

- Security Assessment Report (2-3 pages)
- Risk Priority Matrix (spreadsheet or chart)
- Implementation Roadmap (timeline with milestones)
- Employee Security Checklist (1-page quick reference)

## Learning Resources

- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework basics
- Common security tools (password managers, 2FA, VPN)
